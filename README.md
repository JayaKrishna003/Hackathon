# 🍽️ Zomato Bangalore Restaurant Trends – Solo Hackathon @ Innomatics

This project was built as part of a **solo hackathon** organized by **Innomatics Research Labs**, aimed at performing a data-driven analysis of restaurant trends in **Bangalore** using real-world Zomato data.

## 🎯 Objective

The goal was to uncover meaningful insights from Zomato's dataset by:
- Cleaning and preprocessing restaurant data
- Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Mapping restaurant locations using geolocation data
- Extracting actionable business insights
- Solving reasoning-based questions using the findings

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**:  
  - `pandas`, `numpy` – data manipulation  
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – data visualization  
  - `geopy` – geolocation mapping  
  - `folium`, `plotly` *(optional)* – interactive maps  
  - `Jupyter Notebook` – development environment

## 🔍 Key Insights

- 🍜 **Cuisines**: North Indian and Chinese are the most popular among top-rated restaurants
